# Introduction

This package provides some functions that make it easy to create figures in accordance with the corporate design colors of the Institute for Comprehensive Analysis of the Economy (ICAE) at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz.^[More information about the ICAE can be found [here](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-for-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-economy/).]
